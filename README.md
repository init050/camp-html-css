# Camping Story - Landing Page

This project is a static landing page for a fictional camping company called "Camping Story". It's a single-page website designed to showcase popular tours and camping products.

## Project Overview

The Camping Story landing page is a visually engaging website that uses a clean and modern design to attract potential customers. It features a "Most Popular Tours" section with card-based layouts and a "Camping Products" section with a gallery of items.

This project is a great example of a simple, single-page brochure website, built with HTML and custom CSS.

## Features

*   **Card-based UI:** The tours are presented in a card-based layout, which is a popular and effective design pattern.
*   **Product gallery:** The camping products are displayed in a simple and clean image gallery.
*   **Custom styling:** The website has a unique look and feel thanks to the custom CSS in `style.css`.
*   **Google Fonts:** Uses the "Lato" font from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS:** For custom styling, layout, and animations.

## How to View

To view this website, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/init050/camp-html-css.git
    cd front/camp
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main (and only) page of the website.
*   `style.css`: The custom stylesheet for the project.
*   `assets/`: Contains the images used in the project.

## Future Improvements

*   **Add more pages:** The website could be expanded to include more details about the tours and products on separate pages.
*   **Add interactivity:** JavaScript could be used to add features like a modal for viewing product details or an interactive map for the tour locations.
*   **Make it responsive:** The current layout is not fully responsive. Media queries could be added to ensure that the website looks good on all devices.
*   **Add a contact form:** A contact form would allow potential customers to get in touch with the company.
